# **App Name**: AquaControl IoT

## Core Features:

- Soil Moisture Sensing: Monitor soil moisture levels using a capacitive sensor connected to the ESP32 Node.
- Automated Irrigation: Automatically activate a simulated water pump (LED) or a real water pump via a relay based on soil moisture readings.
- Wireless Communication: Establish a local Wi-Fi network using ESP32 Server (AP) and connect the ESP32 Node as a client for data transmission and remote control.
- Web Interface: Provide a user-friendly web interface hosted on the ESP32 Server to display soil moisture status and enable manual irrigation control.
- Moisture Thresholding: Define custom moisture thresholds to automatically trigger irrigation based on specific plant needs.
- Irrigation Scheduling Tool: AI tool will use sensor readings to determine a personalized watering schedule, optimizing water use based on soil moisture, time of day and weather forecasts.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Soft green (#A7D1AB) to evoke nature and growth.
- Background color: Very light gray (#F2F2F2) for a clean and neutral backdrop.
- Accent color: Light sky blue (#B0E2FF) for interactive elements and highlights, such as the manual irrigation button.
- Body and headline font: 'PT Sans' for a modern yet friendly appearance.
- Use simple, flat icons for moisture levels and control functions.
- Prioritize a clear and intuitive layout with moisture status prominently displayed.
- Subtle animations for status changes (e.g., when irrigation is activated).
